# Mastermind

Requires colorize gem for colors in terminal. I considered using 
"\e[#{color_code}m#{self}\e[0m" for color formatting but for simplicity using colorize is faster.

Colorize can be found at https://github.com/fazibear/colorize
To install simply type "gem install colorize" in terminal.

To start the game simply enter "ruby main.rb" in terminal.
